# Emmanuele Rotondi's Data Analytics Portfolio

Greetings, and thank you for visiting! Within this repository, you'll find demonstrations of projects I've undertaken in Python, SQL, and Tableau. Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuele-rotondi-47a723b6) with any feedback or questions.

## Highlighted Projects

### Netflix Tableau Project
* **Project:** - [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/emmanuele.rotondi/viz/NetflixDashboard_17097708763930/Netflix)
* **Data:** Tableau sample data
* **Audience:** Streaming
* **Purpose:** Analyze the year-over-year growth in the production of movies and shows by Netflix.

In thi dasbhoard, I used Netflix's streaming data to determine the number of shows and movies that the streaming giant produced globally between 2008 and 2020.

### Summer Olympics SQL Project
- **Projec:** - [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/emmanuelerotondi/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/olympics_sql_queries)
- **Data:** [120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)
- **Audience:** Anyone interested in the some fun facts about the Summer Olympics
- **Purpose:** Demonstrate various methods of extracting data from this dataset using PostgreSQL.

In this project, I employed the Kaggle Olympics dataset to execute SQL queries, aiming to extract various data ranges, including the average age of gold medalists and the compilation of top athletes who have achieved the highest number of gold medals.

### Ultra Marathon Races Python Project
- **Project:** [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/emmanuelerotondi/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/ultra_races_py_database.ipynb)
- **Data:** [The big dataset of ultra-marathon running](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/discussion/420633)
- **Audience:** Marathon enthusiast
- **Purpose:** Illustrate the process of data cleaning using Python.

In this project, I utilized the ultra marathon races dataset to eliminate any redundant data, and generated graphs to present statistical insights into athletes participating in these races, with a focus on Chile.
